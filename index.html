            As a professional, I have worked in various IT roles for over
            20 years. I love creating and finding ways to improve the lives 
            of those I work around.

            In my personal time, I love spending time with my wife and three 
            children. I love playing basketball and play almost every week. I 
            go on an annual backpacking trip and took my Beagle for the first 
            time this year. I love working with my hands and enjoy taking 
            things apart to learn how they work and putting them back together.
